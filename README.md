# Import/Export system for Twine Stories

The goal of the project was to build an Import/Export system between Twine and the Wolfram Language. Twine is browser-based software used to make interactive stories and text-based games. A Twine story or game consists of a network of passages and macros that can change the state of variables or other story elements. Graphs and Associations are the primary representational form of Twine stories in the Wolfram Language.
